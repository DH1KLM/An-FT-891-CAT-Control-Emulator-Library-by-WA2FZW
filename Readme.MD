An FT-891 CAT Control Emulator Library by WA2FZW
Version 1.0

This library provides a means of adding CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver)
functionality to Arduino (or other microprocessor) based applications.

I have used it in an ESP32 based digital VFO and my simple interface for
digital audio, which runs on an Arduino Nano. It should work on almost any
of the popular microprocessors.

This was originally developed for a digital VFO project by me, Glenn (VK3PE)
and Jim (G3ZQC).
